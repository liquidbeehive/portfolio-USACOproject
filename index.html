        <h2>Conxtext</h2>
        Itching to stretch my web-redesign muscles, I was on the hunt for a website that not only needed a visual update, but was also actually relevant to me and my peers. After asking around, my friend led me to the <a href="https://usaco.org/index.php">USA Computing Olympiad website</a> -- he had participated in one of their contests when he was younger but the outdated design of their site always stuck with him. 
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="screenshot of USACO website" src="photos/screenshot of USACO website.png"/>
        </p>
	
        Because many young adults/teenagers would be using the site as a means of looking at contests to enter, I wanted to redesign the website not only for accessibility but also to be inviting while easy to navigate.

        <p>Some immediate pain points I wanted to address included:</p>
        After taking a look, I agreed - the font and overall brand is very simplistic but without any real personality, the paragraphâ€™s line spacing is small and makes the text difficult to read, and the separation of content is difficult to discern at a first glance.
        <ul>
            <li>Increasing spacing and readability for wider accessibility</li>
            <li>Providing a better text or layout hierarchy for easier understandability</li>
            <li>Providing a more memorable color scheme and layout for brand identity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h2>Sketches</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            First, I started with some quick sketches of potential redesign layouts.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Again, I wanted to prioritise a clean, yet appealing design. For the final sketch I chose a light blue to match their original color scheme, but chose something brighter to encourage the younger audience and integrated it more thoroughly into the layout.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h2>
            From there, I did a quick lo-fi wireframe in Figma, annotating for the changes I implemented and how they'd address the issues of the original USACO website.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            As I start defining my design, I first develop a style guide to have a consistent font, size, and color scheme in my layouts. I chose a cool, blue and green color scheme in order to maintain the scientific-tech aesthetic, but hopefully in a way that seems more approachable than the gradients and greys of the existing page.
            I also used JetBrains Mono as the key font, which has a pre-existing association with programming and tech, but isn't distinct enough to be offsetting.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            <h2>High-Fidelity Designs</h2>
            Now I add color and images to the designs, so I can get a look at what I image the final product to look like.
            <p>
                <img class = "photo" alt="High-Fidelity Figma Design fit for Macbook" src="photos/MacBook - HiFi.png"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Because this webpage is also intended to be responsive, I've designed prototypes to adapt the webpage to different dimensions.
            </p>
            <div class="photoRow">
            <p>
                <img class = "photo" src="photos/Phone - HiFi.png" alt="High-Fidelity Figma Design fit for Phone"style="height: 40vw; width: auto"/>
            </p>

            This project was my first time being involved in both the front end and the back end -- this helped me not only gain a deeper understanding on how to balance both my artistic vision and my HTML/CSS skills, but also encouraged me to thoughtfully consider my audience as I design: both in terms of their visual appeal, but also on what platforms they'd be viewing the site on.
